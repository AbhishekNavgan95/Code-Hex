# Code-Hex

## Overview
This project replicates a real-world Ed-Tech website structure, featuring multiple pages such as home, about, contact, dashboard, login, and sign-up. While the project doesn't have a GUI for most pages, it serves as a deep dive into React routers, exploring various methods to route pages in a React application. The major focus of this project is implementing React Router and handling information among multiple pages using props.

## Features
- Multiple pages: Home, About, Contact, Dashboard, Login, and Sign-up.
- Forms pages with controlled components for handling and validating user data efficiently.
- Protected routes to guard against direct access to protected pages.
- Implementation of React Router with a focus on useNavigate, Navigate, Link, and NavLink.
- Styling using Tailwind CSS.
- Integration of plugins: React-hot-toasts and react-icons.

## Project Structure
- **src/components:** Contains React components used throughout the project.
- **src/pages:** Individual page components for home, about, contact, dashboard, login, and sign-up.
- **src/App.js:** Main component handling routing and layout.
- **src/App.css:** Styles for the main application.
- **public:** Public assets.
